# Buy-Focused Trading Strategies

This folder contains strategies that primarily focus on identifying opportunities to enter long positions (buy signals). These strategies generally excel in trending markets, especially during uptrends.

## Included Strategies

1. **MA Crossover Strategy**: Uses moving average crossovers to identify trends and momentum.
2. **MACD Strategy**: Uses the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator for momentum-based signals.
3. **Breakout Strategy**: Identifies when price breaks through resistance levels to capture new uptrends.
4. **Adaptive Moving Average Strategy**: Dynamically adjusts moving average periods based on volatility to adapt to market conditions.

These strategies typically generate more buy signals in bullish markets and are most effective when the market is trending upward.
