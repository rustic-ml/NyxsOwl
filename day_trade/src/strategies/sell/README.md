# Sell-Focused Trading Strategies

This folder contains strategies that primarily focus on identifying opportunities to exit positions or enter short positions (sell signals). These strategies excel at identifying market tops, overbought conditions, and reversals.

## Included Strategies

1. **RSI Strategy**: Uses the Relative Strength Index to identify overbought conditions.
2. **Mean Reversion Strategy**: Uses Bollinger Bands to identify when prices are statistically overextended and likely to revert.
3. **Volume-Based Strategy**: Uses volume indicators like OBV and VPT to identify selling pressure and distribution.

These strategies typically generate more sell signals in bearish markets or when prices are overextended, and are most effective when looking to time exits or identify potential price reversals.
