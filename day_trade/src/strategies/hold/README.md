# Hold-Focused and Market-Neutral Trading Strategies

This folder contains strategies that excel in range-bound or choppy markets, or take a balanced approach that doesn't specifically favor directional moves. These strategies often generate more hold signals or balanced buy/sell signals.

## Included Strategies

1. **Bollinger Bands Strategy**: Exploits the tendency of prices to remain within statistical boundaries during ranging markets.
2. **Multi-Indicator Strategy**: Uses a composite of multiple indicators for a balanced approach to trading.
3. **Dual Timeframe Strategy**: Combines signals from different timeframes for a more balanced perspective.
4. **Grid Trading Strategy**: Places orders at predefined intervals to profit from price oscillations in a range.
5. **VWAP Strategy**: Uses Volume-Weighted Average Price to identify value zones where prices tend to revert.
6. **Forecasting Strategy**: Uses statistical methods to forecast future prices based on historical patterns.

These strategies typically excel when markets lack clear direction or cycle between bullish and bearish periods. They often use a combination of overbought/oversold indicators or volatility-based approaches.
