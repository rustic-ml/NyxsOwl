## üì¶ Project Structure

NyxsOwl is organized as a Rust workspace with multiple crates:

- **nyxs_owl**: The core library containing fundamental components and utilities
- **day_trade**: A crate focused on day trading strategies that processes both daily and minute-level OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyxs_owl.git
cd nyxs_owl

# Build all workspace crates
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Update dependencies to latest versions
./update_deps.sh
```

### Dependency Management

NyxsOwl follows a policy of using the latest stable versions of dependencies to ensure we have the most up-to-date features, performance improvements, and security fixes. We achieve this through:

1. **Version Range Specifications**: Dependencies in Cargo.toml use the `>=x.y.z` format to allow automatic updates to newer versions.
2. **Automated Updates**: Weekly checks for dependency updates via GitHub Actions.
3. **Update Script**: The `update_deps.sh` script can be run anytime to manually update all dependencies.

This approach helps us stay current with the Rust ecosystem while maintaining project stability.
